## Naming Convention
In this program we use camelCase as the naming convention. It ensures that functions and variable names are easier to read.

We use classes with a capital first letter, to ensure that classe stand out of functions and variable names.

- File names with: **All lower case letters**
- Functions and variables with: **camelCase**
- Class names with: **First capital letter**


### Examples of code with covention:
```php
<?php
	class Users {
		private function helloWorld() {
			print("Hello World");
		}
	}

	include_once "header.php";
?>
```
